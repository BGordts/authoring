# Videos

After reviewing the screencasts and making any final adjustments to
either the slides or the scripts, the next step is for you to spend one
day (\~6-8 hours) in our professional recording studio in Cambridge, MA.
(Don't worry, we'll cover travel expenses.) Our team is well-trained and
prepared to make sure things go smoothly.

Once the videos are recorded, we will review and edit them, add your
slides in the background, use animations to highlight key points, etc.
Finally, we'll plug the final videos into the course.
