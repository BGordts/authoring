# Review and release

At this point, we will put any finishing touches on the course, then ask
that you review the course in its entirety.

We'll also have a select group of DataCamp students beta test the course
to collect additional feedback and make a final round of updates before
the course goes live. We'll implement as many small adjustments as
possible based on the feedback, but we will need your assistance for
more substantive changes.

Once everyone agrees we're ready to move forward, we will release the
course on the DataCamp website. Congrats!
