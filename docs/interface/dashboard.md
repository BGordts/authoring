*Content dashboard*

The content overview page consists of two parts: a filterable and paginated table of created content and a modal to create new or import existing courses. The table has the following columns:

- **Title**: the title of the course (or repository name if it is not properly built yet)
- **Status**: current state of the content (development, live)
- **Instructors**: instructors of the repository. You can set these in the Settings tab of the master branch of the repository.
- **Last edited**: time when the last update has been done to the content
- **Edit action**: opens editor for editing the content

For premium content some columns are redefined:

- **Edit action**: allows advanced administration of branches and content
