search/replace,
and other common operations.
The editor is used to edit chapters, exercises, and slides.

### Preview

By using preview you can make sure that the content and exercises are behaving as expected before pushing the content to your students.

*Upload assets interface*

Once your assets are uploaded they are placed in the `/datasets` folder.
You can read more about assets by visiting the [Assets Page](/courses/assets.md)

## Saving Content

While you are using the editor, a version of your file is kept on our server.
When you save changes,
that file is written to your course's GitHub repository.
This means that if you accidentally close your browser window,
your changes will not be lost right away.
However,
if you don't save them within two days,
our server will discard them.
