# Vision

Before starting to write a project, it is very important to start with the vision statement, and understand it.

> Projects should allow learners to take the skills they have learnt and apply it to an end-to-end analysis on a real-world **task**, using real-world **tools** and **workflows,** and **showcase** their work.

### Tasks

Projects should be based on real-world content and allow a learner to work on tasks a data scientist is expected to encounter in their daily work. They also need to be end-to-end, allowing the learner to work through the complete data science lifecycle, starting from raw data and ending in interesting insights that can be communicated.
