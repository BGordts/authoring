Test examples
=========================================

This pages contains examples of project `@tests` [for python](#tests-python) and [for R](#tests-r).

`@tests` in python {#tests-python}
-----------------------------------

This is a work in progress. In the meantime you can check out the `@tests` cells in this example `project.ipynb` from the Project *Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing*. Here is the [python GitHub repo](https://github.com/datacamp/projects-discovery-of-handwashing-python) (and [live project](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/20)).
