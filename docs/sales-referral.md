# DataCamp Referral Program For B2B Customers

DataCamp is offering a special promotion where instructors can earn a
referral fee for introducing DataCamp to new prospects.

* You receive a 15% revenue share on the initial contract we sign with
  your referral. (For example if you refer a financial service company
  that buys a $30,000 DataCamp subscription, we would pay you $4,500.)

* Referrals are very easy to make - all you need to do is fill out
  [this referral form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb9tGdH3akd2VA1uQpdftc218K_tEKhIUxAogYZoiH7zdPbg/viewform).
  
* This referral opportunity is in addition to the royalty payments you
  already receive.

* The primary target is businesses but we also sell to government
  agencies and graduate programs at universities.

Note all referrals must be made by July 31, 2018 and the initial
contract must close by December 31, 2018 to qualify.  To learn
more, please contact [Robert Daniel](mailto:robert@datacamp.com).
