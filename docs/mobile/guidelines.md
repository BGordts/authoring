# Guidelines

Talk about guidelines here.

- Context should be at most 150 characters.
- Questions should be at most 60 characters.
- Don't ask questions or use exclamation marks in feedback.
- Be fun! This fits the informality of the mobile format, and also appeals to
  the youths.
- Every lesson should have 8 <= n <= 15 exercises.
- At least the last 2 exercises have to test multiple concepts taught in the
  lesson, and ideally be a bit harder.
- Whatever is between `` should be correct code! E.g., 4 % 3 = 1 is NOT correct
  Python code, but `4 % 3` is.
- Write a comment for every exercise, explaining what the pedagogical purpose
  is. What do you want to test with this exercise?
- Vary exercise types.
- Every lesson should have at least 3 active exercises (tap or reorder).
- Explain a difficult concept with a passive exercise (not reorder or
  tap). Lists, data types, etc. are difficult concepts and need to be introduced
  by passive exercises.
- Exercises should be doable and enjoyable by people completely new to
  programming (your grandparents, your 12 year old cousin), more so than people
  with some experience.
- Teach at most one concept per screen. Mathematical stuff like arguments,
  functionsâ€¦ are also concepts! Try and be as atomic as possible.
- Prereqs of any exercise should only be what has been learned before in the
  app.
