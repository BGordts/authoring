# DataCamp for Mobile

DataCamp for Mobile allows students to engage with their data science learning
content anytime, anywhere (even [on the
toilet](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/mobile-data-science)).

There are two types of mobile content: [courses](/mobile/courses/README.md) and
[practice](/mobile/practice/README.md).
