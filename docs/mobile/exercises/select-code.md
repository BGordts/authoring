# Select Code

Select code exercises require a code block (because the code block is the
correct solution).

```yaml
- key: af0b5d3f-629e-4575-8822-3486b898f5be
  context: "You can use `-` to subtract numbers, just like a calculator."
  output: "3"
  code: "print(8 - 5)"
  distractor_code:
    - option: "print(3 + 4)"
      feedback: "Careful, that would give you `7`."
    - option: "print(10 - 1)"
      feedback: "Careful, that would give you `9`."
```
