# Mobile exercises

Writing a DataCamp for Mobile is quite different than writing a DataCamp
[desktop course](../../courses/readme.md). The upside is that you can reach a
much broader audience because the convenience is much higher while the barrier
to entry is much lower. The challenge is that there are many more
constraints. Primary among these are the restricted screen real estate and the
lack of an interactive interpreter. These constraints require you to think
carefully about the way you introduce concepts and the examples that you use.

# Basic exercise structure

There are roughly 5 exercise types available to you as an author on DataCamp
Mobile, but they all share a similar structure. In general (with a few
exceptions), you can think of an exercise as a short code vignette comprising
various blocks in the following structure:

```yaml
# print()
- key: c11dbdf1-49c9-408a-a1e4-885431af2196
  context: "`print()` outputs to the screen. Whatever you put between the parentheses will be output! E.g. `print(5)` will output `5`!"
  question: "" # this is the default
  code: "print(42)"
  output: "42"
  distractor_output:
    - option: "4"
      feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the first part."
    - option: "2"
      feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the last part."
```

Let's dig into each blocks...

## topic

```yaml
# print()
```

Even though it's not part of the exercise itself, it's a very good idea to
comment your exercises so you can quickly remind yourself what each exercise is
supposed to teach or test. In fact, it can be helpful to start by outlining a
whole lesson with a scaffolding of comments before expanding the exercises.

## key

```yaml
- key: c11dbdf1-49c9-408a-a1e4-885431af2196
```

This is a unique UUID for the exercise.

## context

```yaml
  context: "`print()` outputs to the screen. Whatever you put between the parentheses will be output! E.g. `print(5)` will output `5`!"
```

This is where you can provide exposition necessary to introduce a new
concept. It should be kept as minimal as possible (no longer than 150
characters). It's good to shoot for a lighter, more informal feel here than on
desktop. This field supports markdown elements like `inline code` and
**emboldening**. Emojis are not just supported, they're encouraged!

## question

```yaml
  question: "" # this is the default
```

This field is always optional. It will override the default question for the
relevant exercise type. Don't change this unless you absolutely need to for an
exercise to make sense.

## code

```yaml
  code: "print(42)"
```

This is the code! Anything you here should be syntactically correct, executable
code. The format of the code block can vary slightly for different exercise
types, for example reorder and tap exercises. See the documentation for those
exercise types to get the details.

## output

```yaml
  output: "42"
```

This is the output generated by the code in a code block. That means anything
that would get printed to the console in an interactive Python or R terminal
session.

## distractors

```yaml
  distractor_output:
    - option: "4"
      feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the first part."
    - option: "2"
      feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the last part."
```

The rendered exercise type depends largely on the distractors block. In the
example above, the use of the `distractor_output` field indicates this exercise
will be a select output exercise.

Other distractor types will result in different exercise types:

- distractor_output -> [Select Output](select-output.md)
- distractor_code -> [Select Code](select-code.md)
- distractor_blanks -> [Tap](tap.md)
- distractor_text -> [Multiple Choice](multiple-choice.md)
- distractor_table -> Select Table

The only exercise type that does not require a distractor field is the
[Reorder](reorder.md) .

Regardless of the exercise type, the distractor field is always a list of
distractors (AKA wrong answers). Each individual distractor in the list has two
elements: `option`, the incorrect answer itself, and `feedback`, the feedback
message that students will see if they incorrectly choose that distractor.

# Other available blocks

## complex context

```yaml

```

The `context` block can be more complex than a simple string. Sometimes you need
to introduce a table, image, multi-line code snippet, or output in the context,
*before* the actual exercise code. This really starts to stretch the limits of
what can be displayed on a single screen, so simple text context should always be
strongly preferred.

For example, to include an image such as a plot:

```yaml
context:
  text: Study the plot below to answer the following question.
  image: my-cool-plot
```

In this example, `my-cool-plot` is a reference to an asset specified in the
[course manifest](../repo-structure.md).



    text?: Text,
    image?: Image,
    table?: Table,
    code?: Code,
    output?: Output,

## table

## image

## feedback

## feedback_wrong

## tabs

Tabs appear in the top right of the exercise and serve as a way to display
datasets or

# YAML tips and tricks

You will often be writing code blocks or output blocks that span multiple
lines. You *can* use explicit newlines `\n`, but the easier and more readable
option is to use a feature of the YAML spec known as **literal scalar
blocks**. Just put `|-` after the semicolon `;` of a field and then indent the
following lines by two spaces. Everything in the indented block will be rendered
verbatim, including newlines and all quotes.

Instead of this:

```yaml
solution: "v <- c(4, 9, 3, 5)\norder(v)"
```

Try this:

```yaml

solution: |-
  v <- c(4, 9, 3, 5)
  order(v)
```

A small wrench is thrown into things when the first line of the literal scalar
block needs to start with blank space. When that happens, you need to count the
number of blank spaces at the beginning of the first line `N`, and put that number
`N` after the `|-`. Then, indent the whole block an extra `N` characters. This
is easier demonstrated than explained.

Instead of this:

```yaml
output: "[,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4"
```

Try this:

```yaml
output: |-5
            [,1] [,2]
       [1,]    1    3
       [2,]    2    4
```

See the [YAML spec](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) for more advanced YAML
features that might come in handy, but literal scalar blocks will be what you
need 99% of the time.
