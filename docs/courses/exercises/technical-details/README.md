# Technical details

This section explores some of the more technical details of exercises types. They are provided for reference, but knowing about them is not usually necessary as a course instructor.

Topics include:

- Writing [Solution Correctness Tests](sct.md), to ensure that the student has the right answer.
- How [Experience Points](xp.md) work.
- What's in the [exercise YAML headers](exercise-headers.md).
- What [blocks](exercise-blocks.md) each exercise has.
- Details of the custom [markdown authoring format](unified-authoring-api.md).
