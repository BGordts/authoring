# Writing `VideoExercise` Slides

This page provides guidance on writing good video slides.

## Examples

From [What is code profiling](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/writing-efficient-r-code/diagnosing-problems-code-profiling?ex=1) in "Writing Efficient R Code". As well as having the instructor dressed up to match the dataset being discussed, this also makes good use of images and screenshots.

From [Embrace, Extend, Override](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-r-s3-and-r6/r6-inheritance?ex=5) in "Object-Oriented Programming in R:S3 & R6". This makes use of a physical prop in order to demonstrate the concept. It also includes a summary slide at the end.


## FAQs

### How many slides should I have?

Too few slides can be boring; too many can be overwhelming. A reasonable heuristic is to have "one slide per idea". That is, anytime you introduce a new idea in words, you also change what is onscreen. 


## Good ideas

### Use images

Whether they are pictures, plots, or diagrams, having images in your videos helps students learn, and makes the course adverts more photogenic, which helps to increase the number of students starting your course.

### Use dual coding

When words and visuals match ("dual coding"), it can increase learning relative to a single communication channel.

### Include a summary slide

It can be hard to remember everything that is spoken in a video. Having a summary slide can help students to be aware of what they just learned.


## Common problems and their solutions

### Too much information

Videos need to be understandable in real-time, so err on the side of simplifying things and omitting things.

### Speech and slide mismatches

While complementary speech and slides provide a boost to learning (see "Use dual coding" point), having mismatched speech and slides detracts from learning, since the student has to decifer which to the two media is the one to pay attention to.
