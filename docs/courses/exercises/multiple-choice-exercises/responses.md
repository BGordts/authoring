This page provides guidance on writing good multiple choice responses.

## Examples

From [How does the shell compare to a graphical user interface?](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science/manipulating-files-and-directories?ex=1) in "Introduction to Shell for Data Science". Each wrong answer reflects a common misunderstanding.

## FAQs

### How many responses should I have?

Four or five.

## Good ideas

### Provide distractors that give insight

The distractors ("wrong answers") should ideally provide insight as to what went wrong. That is, they should be the answer a student expects if they have made a common error or misunderstanding.

### Make the student do something

Rather than just asking them a question to test their knowledge, you can make the student actively do something in order to answer the question. For example, You can make them write some code to explore a dataset, or make them look at and interpret a plot or diagram.

### Test principles

Similarly, rather than just testing the students' knowledge of facts, it can be good to test the students' understanding of principles.

## Common problems and their solutions

### Having an "all of the above" response

If the students identify two correct statements, they will often be able to guess that "all of the above" is the correct response. Don't use this.

### Having a "none of the above" response

You can't test that the student know the correct response. Don't use this.

### Trivially wrong answers

Having silly or obviously wrong answers simply makes the exercise easier, and reduces the opportunity for learning.

### Different response lengths

Having some answers that contain a lot more or a lot less text than other answers can draw students attention to those answers. Try to keep each answer roughly the same length.
