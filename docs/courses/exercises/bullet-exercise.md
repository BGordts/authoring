# Bullet Exercise

A `BulletExercise` allows an exercise to be presented as a series of smaller sub-exercises, which makes each step easier. They are best suited to teach a single concept by focusing on its different aspects.

__Examples__

1. [Bullet Exercise in SQL](examples/md/sql/BulletExercise.md)
2. [Bullet Exercise in R](examples/md/r/BulletExercise.md)
3. [Bullet Exercise in Python](examples/md/python/BulletExercise.md)

Please read [this article](/courses/guides/tab-vs-bullet-exercises.html) to understand how to choose between a `BulletExercise` and a `TabExercise`.

## Bullet Console Exercise

A `BulletConsole` exercise is just like a `BulletExercise`, but its sub-exercises must all be `ConsoleExercise`s. State is preserved between sub-exercises to give a sense of progression through the overall exercise. This exercise type is currently supported only for Shell courses.
