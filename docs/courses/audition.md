# Creating Your Audition Video

To ensure we continue delivering the best possible learning experience
for our students, we have every new DataCamp instructor go through a
brief audition process. Prior to beginning this process, we recommend
going through some of our [existing courses][datacamp-courses] to get
a feel for our code-centric, learn-by-doing approach to teaching data
science.

## Format

You'll create a **5-10 minute screencast** teaching a data science topic
of your choice in one of the following formats:

-   Slideshow (PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.)
-   Notebook (Jupyter, R, etc.)
-   Live coding (your favorite IDE, terminal, etc.)

You should expect to **spend somewhere between 2 and 5 hours** creating
your screencast.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of auditions we have particularly liked (used
with permission):

-   Sarah Guido: [Decision Trees][guido-video] (slideshow)
-   Kevin Markham: [Renaming DataFrame Columns] (Jupyter Notebook)
-   Nick Tierney: [Exploring Missing Data][tierney-video] (slideshow)
-   Becca Krouse: [Power & Sample Size in RCTs][krouse-video] (slideshow)
-   Laurent Gatto: [Accessing Raw Mass Spectrometry Data in R][gatto-video] (live coding)

And here's one that is deliberately bad, along with some comments on
why:

-   Greg Wilson: [How *not* to introduce functions in Python][wilson-video]
-   [Notes][wilson-notes]

## Evaluation

Your screencast will be evaluated based on these criteria:

-   Audience
    -   Is the topic interesting and relevant for DataCamp students?
    -   Is it clear what assumptions are made about the audience?

-   Communication
    -   Is the text clearly legible?
    -   Did you prepare a script and rehearse?
    -   Do you speak clearly?
    -   Do you provide sufficient motivation for your subject?
    -   Do you include diagrams, images, or plots?

-   Content
    -   Is the content technically accurate?
    -   Do you use interesting, real-world datasets and examples?
    -   Does the material follow a logical progression (i.e., tell a story)?
    -   Do you explain everything clearly (code, concepts, etc.)?
    -   Do you show rather than tell?

-   Format
    -   Is the screencast between 5 and 10 minutes long?
    -   Is it in one of three formats listed above?

## Recording

If you're using a Mac, we recommend using QuickTime Player to record
your screen. If you're on Windows, there are plenty of free options
for screen recording, including [Icecream Screen Recorder][icecream]
and [CamStudio][camstudio]. If you are using Linux we recommend
[ScreenStudio][screenstudio].

If you have two screens available, it is useful to record one screen
and have your script visible to you on the second screen. If you prefer
a printed script, lay it all out so that you don't have to turn pages
while you're recording. Either way, do a brief test to check your sound
levelsâ€“we want to hear you!

## Submission

Upload your video to DataCamp's [Dropbox account][datacamp-dropbox].
Please include your first and last names in the video filename and
send us an email when it's uploaded so we can take a look! For
example, `jane-smith_big-machine-learning.mov` is a good, informative
file name.

Note that you have permission to upload, but not to view or edit the
files in the Dropbox directory. Make sure that the upload completes
before closing the browser window.

## Decision

We will review your audition as quickly as we can: you can expect to
receive a response from your DataCamp contact within two weeks of
submitting your audition.
