# Exercises

The following section will be about editing exercises. Since this is the most substantial part of
authoring, we divided the section in three subsections:

1. [General](exercises/general.md): example of a workbook source and explains the naming convention
1. [Meta Sheet](exercises/meta.md): what is the meta sheet and what to put into it
1. [Solution Sheet](exercises/solution.md): how to define the solution to an exercise
1. [Sample Sheet](exercises/sample.md): how to define the sample data for an exercise
1. [SCT Sheet](exercises/sct.md): how to write SCTs (Submission Correctness Tests) for exercises
1. [Content guidelines](exercises/content-guidelines.md): what are the content guidelines and how
   are they enforced
1. [Video Exercises](exercises/video.md): support for video exercises
1. [Multiple Choice Exercises](exercises/multiple-choice.md): support for multiple choice exercises
