# Step 1 - What problem(s) will student learn how to solve?

Write a list of ideas for problems that the students will encounter in the course. Don't worry about whether they are good or bad ideas, and don't worry about the order. Filtering and sorting comes later.


## Examples

From a course on generalized additive models:

- How to use Generalized Additive Models to understand relationships between variables in data and make predictions.

From a course on fraud detection:

- How to identify and predict fraudulent transactions
- How to effectively work with highly imbalanced data

From a course on human resource analytics:

- How to compare high- and low-performing groups (see Work Rules! pages 201, 343)
- How to identify the most effective recruiting channel (how does this generalize?)
- How to determine what's driving (attrition, high/low performance, etc.)

From a course on psychological methods:

- Use eigenvalues to determine the dimensionality of their data.
- Determine when to use an exploratory vs. a confirmatory analysis.
- Conduct an exploratory factor analysis to investigate item loadings and refine their measure.
- Conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to see how well their proposed model fits the data.

From a course on deep learning with keras:

- Primary goal of the course: learn the keras functional API
- Learn category embeddings
- Learn word embeddings
- Learn RNNs using word embeddings


## FAQs

### How many items should I list?

Many courses list four or five problems to solve. This helps to divide the course up into chapters later on. 

Don't feel obliged to stick to this format. Some courses list a single overarching problem to solve, and other courses list a dozen problems. 


## Good ideas

### Add references

If you come across good ideas for things to teach, make a note of where you found those ideas. For example, you can link to other syllabuses, or note pages of books that had a ideas on things to teach.

### Be exhaustive

Don't be afraid to list bad ideas: it's better to have too many ideas at this stage than too few. One trick is to keep listing items until they start to get silly. You can include these items to ensure that you Curriculum Lead is concentrating when they review your work.


## Common problems and their solutions

### I can't think of any ideas

- If you know what technology you want to use, try reading the documentation for it.

- Read through the contents pages of books on the subject. Amazon's "Look inside" feature is useful for this.


## How will this be reviewed?

Brainstorming questions are not reviewed (though they provide important context for reviewers).
