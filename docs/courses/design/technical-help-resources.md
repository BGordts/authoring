# Markdown and GitHub help resources

In order to get started, you need some basic skills in writing markdown and using GitHub.

## Learn to write markdown

This document is written in Github-flavored markdown. If you don't know how to write it, please take [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) or read [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Learn to edit files with github

The course spec is written entirely in the `README.md` file. GitHub has instructions on [how to edit a file](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository). In Step 6 of that document, "add your commit" means "save your changes to the file".

If you want to take your skills further, these resources will help.

- The [Introduction to git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) course is suitable for complete beginners (and you get to see some good practices for DataCamp courses as you take it).

- For R users, Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com) is another high quality beginner-friendly resource.
