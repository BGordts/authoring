# Markdown and GitHub help resources

In order to get started, you need some basic skills in writing markdown and using GitHub.

## Learn to write markdown

This document is written in GitHub-flavored markdown. If you don't know how to write it, please take [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) or read [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Learn to edit files with GitHub

The course spec is written entirely in the `README.md` file. GitHub has instructions on [how to edit a file](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository). In Step 6 of that document, "add your commit" means "save your changes to the file".

## Learn to work with GitHub Issues

DataCamp uses GitHub Issues to record feedback on the course, and to document any problems.

- To view the Issues related to your course, click on the "Issues" pane near the top left of the screen.
- Github has many bitesize guides to [working with issues](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-your-work-with-issues/).
- In particular, you'll likely want to read about [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue).
- GitHub also has a longer guide to [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues).

## Learn more advanced git skills

If you want to take your skills further, these resources will help.

- The [Introduction to git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) course is suitable for complete beginners (and you get to see some good practices for DataCamp courses as you take it).

- For R users, Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com) is another high quality beginner-friendly resource.
