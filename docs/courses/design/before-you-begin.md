# Before you begin

In order to get started, you need some basic skills in writing markdown, using GitHub, and an idea of the type of course you will make.

## Learn to write markdown

This document is written in Github-flavored markdown. If you don't know how to write it, please take [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) or read [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Learn to edit files with github

The course spec is written entirely in the `README.md` file. GitHub has instructions on [how to edit a file](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository). In Step 6 of that document, "add your commit" means "save your changes to the file".
