# Learner Personas

Terms like "beginner" and "expert" mean different things to different people,
so we use personas help instructors clarify a course's audience.
When designing a specific course,
instructors should explain how it will or won't help these people,
and what extra skills or prerequisite knowledge they are assuming their students have
above and beyond what's included in the persona.

Note: these personas mention some specific technologies or domains,
such as Python or epidemiology.
When using these personas,
replace these by equivalent levels of knowledge about technologies or domains appropriate to your course,
e.g.,
novice understanding of R but advanced understanding of medical imaging
(or vice versa).

## Unaware Umberto

- Age: 25
- Location: London, UK
- Education: Bachelor in Economic History - King's College London
- Personal: Partially deaf, so prefers materials with closed captioning.

**Previous Job**

- Financial advisor at Lloyds Banking Group.

**Current Job**

- Entry-level financial adviser at KPMG.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Umberto's degree gave him an excellent grounding in economic theory,
but the only quantitative work he did was with very small data sets
using Excel and a little bit of copy-and-pase SPSS.  The managers he
worked with so far in his projects used more complex spreadsheets and
some software packages developed in house; he hasn't yet had much
exposure to R, Python, SQL, or other stars in the data science
constellation, and is only vaguely aware of how they could help him.
However, Umberto is constantly looking for easier and more efficient
ways of doing his job tasks-at-hand to move up in his demanding
career.

**DataCamp Experience**

Umberto doesn't know DataCamp. 

**Career Goal**

Aware that his background hasn't given him the samel quantitative
skills as many of his peers, Umberto is set on learning as much as
possible as quickly as he can. He loves the on the job trainings and
wants to build knowledge so he can grow into a project lead role.

> Building analytical reasonings and spreadsheet models from scratch
> is what I like and spend most of my time at work doing.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Doing things correctly and efficiently.
- Growing as fast as his colleagues.

## Starting Sindhu

- Age: 28
- Location: Bangalore, Karnataka, India
- Education: Bachelor in Biochemistry, Master in Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry - University of Mumbai
- Personal: Likes things she can do on the move (e.g., podcasts).

**Previous Jobs**

- Chemist at waste recycling company.

**Current Job**

- Scientist at a pharmaceuticals company.

**Career Goal**

Sindhu works in a team of scientists researching the effectiveness of
vaccines. She invests a lot of time in the lab, and in summarizing and
reporting her results to her superiors. She is constantly looking for
better ways of doing so and hopes to one day become the principal
scientist on her team.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Sindhu came out of university with expert-level knowledge of
immunology, but only knows basic statistical concepts and
techniques. However, needing to visualise a lot of her findings,
Sindhu quickly found that nor Excel and JMP - the tools used in her
team - nor SPSS - the software used in university - were as
customizable as she would have liked. Moreover, she lost a lot of time
building her model from scratch each time.  A quick survey among
research scientist friends led her to R and DataCamp.  After two free
courses and the relief that it was actually doable, Sindhu subscribed.

**DataCamp Experience**

Expecting a steep and long learning curve, Sindhu was pleasantly
surprised to see how fast DataCamp made her put her hands on the
keyboard to code herself.  These quick exercises and immediate
feedback still are what keeps Sindhu motivated and thinking she can
actually do this. The tracks and the fact that DataCamp is well
curated and has things in one place are a big plus for her as
well. She misses being able to easily export the code so she can keep
it with the slides.

> I was surprised to see how you had to code from the get go. As a
> chemist with no data science background, this made all the
> difference in giving me confidence.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Whether she'll be able to get it
  (steep and long learning curve of data science).
- Where to start
  (which language and which skills or topics).

## Coder Chen

- Age: 42
- Location: Calgary, Alberta, Canada
- Education: Bachelor of Computer Science - University of Saskatchewan
- Personal: Highly motivated by the social side of learning.

**Previous Jobs**

- E-commerce application developer.
- Software project manager.
- Co-founder of software development consultancy (acquired by farm machinery firm).

**Current Job**

- VP of software development, Lewis Agricultural.

**Career Goal**

Chen is responsible for a group of 30 programmers developing software
for next-generation farm machinery. Her team is now responsible for
developing applications that will help customers analyze and
understand the large volumes of data being collected by sensors placed
in the field and on their equipment.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Chen has a strong programming background, but has never taken a
statistics course, and her data visualization experience is limited to
creating budget reports for management in Excel.  Knowing that she
needed to learn some basic statistics in order to do her job, she
asked one of the company's financial team to recommend some online
courses.  This led her to DataCamp, and after working through a
handful of courses on R, she has now purchased six seats for her team
members to use as well.

**DataCamp Experience**

Chen was originally worried that her lack of mathematical background
would make it hard for her to work through courses in the time she
had.  She was quickly reassured by the way that lessons move in small,
digestible steps, and by the way that the interactive interface let
her tinker with code as she went along.

> I originally started this because my job required it, but I
> discovered that I was enjoying learning something new.  I
> particularly like discussion on the Slack channel with people doing
> so many different things.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Whether she has the necessary mathematics background
  (and whether she can fill in the gaps in the time she can afford to invest).

## Mathematical Marta

- Age: 28
- Location: Prague, Czech Republic
- Education: PhD in Mathematics - Charles University
- Personal: Retraining after deciding not to pursue an academic career.

**Previous Jobs**

- PhD student in pure mathematics.
- Two summer research jobs (both doing pure math).
- One-year post-doctoral position (also in pure math).

**Current Job**

- Unemployed.

**Career Goal**

Marta recently completed a post-doc in non-homotopic knot theory,
having done her PhD in the same subject.  She has decided that she
doesn't want to pursue an academic career, and wants to retrain as a
data scientist: several of her friends from theoretical physics have
already done so, and she thinks what they're doing is both interesting
and useful. However, she hasn't done statistics since she was an
undergraduate, and knows next to nothing about finance, logistics,
marketing, and other domains where data science is used.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Marta is very comfortable with mathematical abstractions, and is able
to make sense of abstruse theory quickly and easily, but even the one
stats course she did eight years ago was theoretically oriented.  She
is aware that real-world data is sometimes messy, but hasn't had to
deal with that messiness herself.

**DataCamp Experience**

Marta was originally worried that her lack of real-world experience
would make it hard for her to understand the examples in DataCamp
courses.  She has found that is occasionally the case, but has usually
been able to fill in the gaps in her knowledge by browsing Wikipedia.
She sometimes wishes that DataCamp courses spent more time on the
mathematical underpinnings of the methods being used - she is
accustomed to proofs, proofs, and more proofs - but has been
pleasantly surprised to find how much she enjoys programming.

> I started this because I wanted to do the kind of work my friends
> are doing.  I'm continuing with it because I find it just as
> challenging as the theory I used to do.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Whether she can catch up with people who have been programming for
  years.

## Advanced Alex

- Age: 34
- Location: Reno, Nevada, USA
- Education: Bachelor in Mathematics and Master in Finance & Risk Management - University of Nevada
- Personal: Interested in teaching courses himself some day.

**Previous Jobs**

- Pricing analyst for a power distributor.
- Financial analyst at Bank of America.

**Current Job**

- Head quantitative analyst in a small hedge fund.

**Career Goal**

After developing his skill set and finding out what he likes in
previous jobs, Alex is set on staying in this role for quite a
while. He was recently made part of the management team. His main
concern is driving the company forward and outpacing competitors.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Having touched the basics of data science in his education, Alex is
currently using Python in his job. To get better and improve his
business' competitive edge, he went looking for more Python skills.
Google and forums led him to try edX and DataCamp. DataCamp's renowned
instructors and the fact that respected institutions use it pulled
Alex in. Today, he uses DataCamp as his first foundational resource
and supplements it with specific, more in depth courses on Coursera.

**DataCamp Experience**

The main draw for Alex is that DataCamp brings him high-level
understanding of what's out there in the data science field, on pace
with the new developments. He doesn't mind shopping around for more
specific and in-depth content, but could see this becoming a bit
annoying in the future. In any case, the business value of DataCamp
for him lies in the apply fast way the learning experience is set up.

> From a business perspective, I need to be able to apply the data
> science I learn straight away - I can't afford to first spend 3
> months learning without being able to apply.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Such a fast moving field
  (focusing on the right data science subjects).
- So many views and approaches
  (having the right take on certain topics)
- Getting data science to really work for him
  (how to apply and build business value).
