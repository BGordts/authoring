## Step 1: [Brainstorming](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/#step-1-brainstorming)

### 1. [What problem(s) will students learn how to solve?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-problems.md)

### 2. [What techniques or concepts will students learn?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-concepts.md)

### 3. [What technologies, packages, or functions will students use?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-technologies.md)

### 4. [What terms or jargon will you define?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-jargon.md)

### 5. [What analogies or heuristics will you use?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-analogies.md)

### 6. [What mistakes or misconceptions do you expect?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-mistakes.md)

### 7. [What datasets will you use?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-datasets.md)

## Step 2: [Who Is This Course for?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/#step-2-who-is-this-course-for)

*Read the [learner personas](personas.md) and [advice](](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/choose-learner-personas.md), then choose the two best fits for the course and describe why you chose them.*

* Student 1: discussion.
* Student 2: discussion.

## Step 3: [What Will Learners Do Along the Way?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/#step-3-what-will-learners-do-along-the-way)

*Write full descriptions of a couple of [significant exercises](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/exercises-capstone.md) to show how far learners are likely to get.*

### Title of Exercise

*Describe the exercise here, including the learning objectives, concepts taught, and any other important details.*

**Solution**

```
Include the code that you expect the students to write by the end of the course.
It should typically be 2 or 3 lines.
```

### Other Exercises

*Write brief descriptions of 10 to 15 [more exercises](https://authoring.datacamp.comhttps://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/exercises-examples.md) throughout the course.
After this step you should have a clear idea of the flow of the course.*

#### Exercise title 1

- Describe the exercise.
- Mention the learning objectives.
- Two or three bullets points is enough.

**Solution**

```
Solution code here.
It should typically be 2 or 3 lines.
```

#### Exercise title 2

- Describe the exercise.
- â€¦

**Solution**

```
Solution code here.
```

## Step 4: [How Are the Concepts Connected?](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/#step-4-how-are-concepts-connected)

*Remind yourself about [course terminology](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design#terminology-and-structure), then [describe the flow](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/#lesson-flow.md) of the course.*

  - Lesson 1.1
  - Lesson 1.2
  - Lesson 1.3
- Chapter 2

  - Lesson 2.2
  - Lesson 2.3

The datasets are:

- `path/to/dataset-1`: data set 1
- `path/to/dataset-2`: data set 2
