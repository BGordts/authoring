# Step 5.2 - Course Learning Objectives

Write a list of learning objectives for the course. These are not shown to the students, but they will be used to ensure your vision for the course aligns with the vision of your Curriculum Lead. 

## Examples

From a course on scikit-learn. This nicely clarifies the point of the course.


- Learn the key concepts of supervised learning and how to implement them on real-world datasets;
- Learn to distinguish regression from classification problems;
- Learn to evaluate how well your classification and regression modes perform;
- Learn best practices in supervised learning, such as splitting into test/train sets and k-fold cross validation;
- Learn how to improve model performance by both preprocessing your data and regularizing your models.

From a course on single cell RNA-Seq analysis. This is exhaustive in describing the objectives.

- Explain difference between bulk and single-cell rna-seq (amplification bias and dropouts)
- Exploratory data analysis (biases: library size, batch, cell-cycle)
- Make clear what normalization means and why it is needed
- Use main dimensionality reduction methods: PCA, tsne, zinbwave
- List main methods for clustering and perform clustering on real dataset
- Compare different clustering methods
- Understand difference between parametric and non-parametric tests
- Distinguish NB and ZINB distributions
- List main methods for DE analysis and perform DE analysis on real dataset
- Explore and visualize results of DE analysis
 


## FAQs

### How many objectives should I write?

One objective per chapter is typical, but three to ten is acceptable.

## Good ideas

### Talk about problems, techniques, and technologies

There are three reasons why student might take a course. They might want to know how to solve a particular problem, they might want to learn a new technique, or they might want to learn to use a new technology (or package). Consequently, each learning objective should relate to at least one of these three ideas.


## Common problems and their solutions

### Being too vague

If the objectives for the course aren't clear to you, then they really won't be to the students. Try to make the objectives specific enough that as you the course, you can check back to see if the exercises will help work towards those objectives.


## How will this be reviewed?

This step will be reviewed by at least two people other than your curriculum lead, possibly including an external reviewer. They will look for the following points.

- Are there a sensible number of objectives?
- Is each objective specific?
- Does each objective sounds useful and interesting?
- Overall, do the objectives make the course sound worthwhile for students to take?
