# Step 1 - What techniques or concepts will students learn?

Write a list of ideas for techniques and concepts that you want to teach in the course. As with the previous question, don't worry about whether they are good or bad ideas, and don't worry about the order. Filtering and sorting comes later.

## Examples

From a course on generalized additive models:

*Concepts:*

- Splines, Basis Functions
- Model formulas
  - Additivity vs Interactions
- Smoothing
- Penalization

*Skills/Techniques:*

- Fitting a GAM to data
  - Univariate
  - Multivariate
  - Multivariate with interactions between variables
- Checking that a GAM fits well
  - Checking that the GAM is sufficiently wiggly
  - Checking that residuals are well-distributed
  - Checking that the model is not adversely affected by correlations between variables
- Visualizing a GAM
  - Plotting the parts of a GAM
  - Plotting confidence intervals and residuals
- Making predictions
  - Generating predictions on the fitted dataset
  - Generating predictions with new dataset
  - Generating predictions with just parts of the GAM
  - Visualizing predictions
- Selecting predictor variables (maybe too much)
  - Penalizing variables to reduce them
- Fitting, checking, visualizing a model with binary outcomes


From a course on fraud detection:

- How to use resampling methods to tackle imbalance of data, which performance metrics to look at when data is highly imbalanced
- How to apply clustering techniques to detect anomaly observations in an unlabelled dataset
- How to use ensemble methods and cost-sensitive learning to predict fraudulent transactions in a labelled dataset

From a course on human resource analytics:

- How to compare high- and low-performing groups (see Work Rules! pages 201, 343)
- How to identify the most effective recruiting channel (how does this generalize?)
- How to determine what's driving (attrition, high/low performance, etc.)

From a course on psychological methods:

- Students will learn how to explore, refine, and evaluate a measure of a latent trait.
- They will also learn about how to detect and handle dimensionality in a dataset.

From a course on deep learning with keras:

- Keras functional API
- Embedding layers
- RNNs (specifically GRU)

## FAQs

### How many items should I list?

This varies a lot from course to course, but is typically between two and twenty items.

## Good ideas

### Add references

If you come across good ideas for things to teach, make a note of where you found those ideas. For example, you can link to other syllabuses, or note pages of books that had a ideas on things to teach.

### Be exhaustive

Don't be afraid to list bad ideas: it's better to have too many ideas at this stage than too few. One trick is to keep listing items until they start to get silly. You can include these items to ensure that you Curriculum Lead is concentrating when they review your work.

## Common problems and their solutions

### I can't think of any ideas

- If you know what technology you want to use, try reading the documentation for it.

- Read through the contents pages of books on the subject. Amazon's "Look inside" feature is useful for this.

- Wikipedia has a big [list of statistical articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statistics_articles).

## How will this be reviewed?

Brainstorming questions are not reviewed (though they provide important context for reviewers).
