# Course Naming Rules

## Avoid `Introduction to` prefix

This is reserved for free courses introducing technologies. Insturctors often request that their course be called "Introduction to" something to make it sound beginner friendly. However, the majority of our courses introduce something new, so it doesn't make sense from a curriculum point of view to allow this.

Bad: "Introduction to Epidemiology in R"  
Good: "Descriptive Epidemiology in R"  

## Use `in R/Python` suffix whenever possible

The R and Python curricula have a lot of overlap. To avoid confusion, it is useful to specify the language in the name of the course.

Bad: "Sentiment Analysis"  
Good: "Sentiment Analysis in Python"  

## Maximum of 50(ish) characters

The name must fit on a badge, and on adverts. There is a little leeway with the total number of characters but aim for less than 50.

Bad: "Specifying Queries to Optimize Portfolio Returns Using Statistical Theory and Time Series Analysis in PostgreSQL"  
Good: "Portfolio Analysis in PostgreSQL"  

## Be as specific as possible

You have to bear in mind potential name clashes with courses that we haven't made yet! The title should accurately reflect the scope of the course.

Bad: "Machine Learning in Python"  
Good: "Support Vector Machines for Survival Analysis in Python"  

## Use Title Case

[Important](http://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/capital_letters_title_case.htm) Words get an Initial Upper Case Letter but Filler Words do Not. Technology or package names should be written using their usual casing; do not convert these to Title case.

Note that this does not apply the GitHub repository name for the course, which should be in lower-shish-kebab-case.

Bad: "BIG DATA in SPARK using SPARKR"  
Good: "Big Data in Spark using SparkR"   

## Use internationally understandable names

In particular, avoid the US university course numbering scheme (`101`, etc.).

Bad: "Exploring Pitch Data in R"  
Good: "Exploring Baseball Pitch Data in R"

## Avoid abbreviations and acronyms

Don't abbreviate words in order to try and hit the 50 character limit. Having to interpret the title discourages students from taking the course. Instead, try rewriting the title.

Bad: "Applying 'KIS,S' Principles to Datavis in R"  
Good: "'Keep It Simple, Stupid' for Data Visualization in R"

## For related courses, use "Advanced" prefix

For series of more than two related courses, it's best to have descriptive names to distinguish them. Failing that, you can also distinguish them by calling the second course "Intermediate" or "Advanced".

Note that the previous convention of numbering courses with a `(Part i)` suffix is deprecated &ndash; tracks are used to indicate relative position.

Bad: "Junior Working with Web Data in bash", "Sophomore Working with Web Data in bash", and "Senior Working with Web Data in bash"  
Good: "Working with Web Data in bash: Accessing APIs", "Working with Web Data in bash: Scraping Web Pages", and "Working with Web Data in bash: Sharing Your Datasets"
