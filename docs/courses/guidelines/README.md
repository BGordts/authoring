## Guidelines

We want DataCamp content to have as consistent a style and experience as possible.
The articles in these sections list out how you should write your content,
what writing style you should adopt,
and when to choose for certain types of exercises.
We have also included two worked-out exercises,
[one in R](exercise-critique-r.md)
and [one in Python](exercise-critique-python.md),
along with the feedback our Content Developers would give on them.
