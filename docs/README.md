# Welcome

Everybody can teach by using the DataCamp platform. This documentation aims to be a comprehensive guide to creating your own content on DataCamp.

## What content can I create?

DataCamp supports different types of content you can create being:

### Courses
Purpose of creating the course is to educate your students on the subject through the series of videos, slides and different exercises.  

[![Start a course](images/courses/introduction-to-sql-for-data-science.png)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science)
A good example of a course is [_Introduction to SQL for Data Science_](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) which you can start for free to familiarize yourself with the DataCamp Learn environment.

### Challenges
Once your students have finished taking the course you may want to strenghthen their knowledge by creating challenges.  
Challenges are different to courses as the sole purpose is to question student's knowledge. All challenges presented to the student are always randomized, a good example of how the challenges interface looks like is:

> #### info::Note
> _Challenges are going to be available soon, meanwhile you can read the [documentation](challenges/README.md)_

### Projects
DataCamp Projects is an exiting new teaching format that allow students to flex their skills when completing an applied data science task. [Here is the documentation for how to create a DataCamp project](projects/README.md).

If you've never seen a DataCamp project then you'll quickly get the gist by watching this intro video:

> #### info::WANT TO CREATE A PROJECT? 
> Currently only invited creators can create Projects on DataCamp, but we're always looking for engaged professionals and academics who want to help us teach Data Science. If you want to create a Project, please contact rasmus@datacamp.com for more info!
