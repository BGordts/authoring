## Content guidelines

When writing exercises, a few criteria are checkd in your meta sheets. These criteria will help you
write exercises that follow the DataCamp content guidelines. If you violate the guidelines, the
correspending fields will be highlighted in red. Your chapter will still build, but know that you'll
have to come back and fix this exercise.

There are currently 3 guidelines in place:

- Assignment length: between 180 and 780 characters
- Instructions length: between 240 and 480 characters
- Number of instructions: between 2 and 4 bullet points
- Hint length: between 180 and 360 characters
- Number of hints: between 2 and 4 bullet points

Here's how a content guideline violation might look in the authoring interface:
