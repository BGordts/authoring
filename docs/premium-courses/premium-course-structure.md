# Premium course structure

After developing dozens of interactive courses, we've learned a few
things about how to ensure a fluid and engaging experience for students.
In addition to improving course quality, these best practices help us to
provide consistency across our entire course library.

A **course** should...

-   Be 2.5-4 hours of student time.
-   Contain 44-60 exercises spread over 4-5 chapters.
-   Be a mix of videos and interactive exercises, with video content
    accounting for roughly 25% of a student's time.

A **chapter** should...

-   Take an average student \~35-50 minutes to complete.
-   Contain 3-4 videos.
-   Have 10-16 interactive exercises (except for chapter 1, which should
    have 8-12).
-   Be structured so that each video is followed by 2-4 interactive
    exercises.
-   Not contain too many multiple choice exercises.

A **video** should...

-   Be 2-4 minutes in length.
-   Focus on preparing the student for upcoming exercises.
-   Use concrete examples, with code, data, and visuals (plots,
    diagrams, etc.).
-   Avoid bullets as much as possible.

An **interactive exercise** should...

-   Use *either* the second person ("you") or third person ("we"), but not both. 
-   Be possible to complete in 2-3 minutes.
-   Use interesting examples, preferably with real data.
-   Comply with the DataCamp [style
    guide](https://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation#tab_style_guide_general).
-   Contain very clear instructions, so that the student knows exactly
    what is expected of her (what new object to create, whether to print
    something, etc.). The instructions should be enough to finish the
    exercise; the comments in the sample and solution code only serve as
    placeholders for the code without giving any additional information.
-   Contain identical comments in the sample and solution code.
