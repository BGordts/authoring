# Slides and scripts

You will record the videos for your course in front of a green screen in
our professional recording studio. The green screen allows us to display
slides in the background, which will enable you to walk students through
important concepts and examples in a concrete and concise way, preparing
them to complete the interactive exercises. The slides will also be made
available for reference as students are working through the exercises.

In addition to the slides, you will also script out exactly what you'll
say in the videos. We'll feed these scripts into our teleprompter when
you're in the studio. Although writing scripts takes some additional
time upfront, it makes the recording process far more efficient and the
resulting videos significantly more polished and professional.

You will create all slides and scripts in the 'Slide Editing' mode of
the [course editor](http://www.datacamp.com/teach), which is accessible
via the menu bar:

A few pieces of advice before you get started:

-   Videos should generally be 2-4 minutes a piece, so don't try to cram
    too many slides into each video
-   Minimize the number of purely conceptual talking points (i.e.
    bullets)
-   Focus on walking the student through interesting, real-world
    examples with data, code, and visuals (plots, diagrams, etc.)
-   DataCamp has an account with
    [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/home), letting you
    include professional images in your slides
-   Think about how the slides will prepare students for the specific
    exercises that follow
-   Avoid going through the exact same examples you'll have the student
    work on in the exercises. Instead, vary the examples slightly by,
    for example, performing the same operations on a different dataset
    (or different parts of the same dataset) or by performing slightly
    different operations on the same dataset
