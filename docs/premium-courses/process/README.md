# Introduction

The purpose of this section is to guide you through the step-by-step
process of developing a premium DataCamp course. The emphasis here is on
helping you to stay organized and on schedule and to make it clear what
your responsibilities are and how we can help.

We'll set up a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository (a.k.a. *repo*)
under the [DataCamp organization](https://github.com/datacamp), where
all of your course materials will be kept. This will allow us to
collaborate seemlessly by keeping everything in one place, tracking
changes to documents over time, and providing a system for proposing and
merging changes. **If you're new to GitHub, take a moment to [create a
free account](https://github.com/) and provide us with your GitHub
username so we can add you as a collaborator to the repo**.
