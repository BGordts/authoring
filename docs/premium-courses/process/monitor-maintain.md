# Monitor and maintain

Since your course will be exposed to thousands of students all over the
world, we will quickly learn of any improvements that need to be made.
For small stuff like typos or issues with hints or answer testing, our
team will make the necessary adjustments without bothering you. If,
however, there are any serious issues with the content that require your
expertise or input, we'll be sure to notify you immediately, then work
with you to resolve them.
